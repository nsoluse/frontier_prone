# frontier_prone
This script allows the character to take a lying position and crawl in all four directions. 

The key to switch to the prone position is B. Also, it is responsible for getting out of this position, but there is another exit key - Z, it is needed for those who have a hotkey to cancel animations.
To start moving, use WASD. This is all synchronized between the players, and various checks will not allow the player to use this script in the water, on transport, and so on.

Also, thanks to PerryHX for providing their developments to create this script.
